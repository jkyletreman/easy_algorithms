## Algorithms

### Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

### Reverse An Integer
Reverse digits of an integer. Don't create strings or turn it into a string.

Example 1:
Input: 123 Output: 321

Example 2:
Input: -123 Output: -321

Example 3:
Input: 120 Output: 21

### Group Anagrams
Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

For example, given: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"], Return:

[ ["ate", "eat","tea"], ["nat","tan"], ["bat"] ]

### Letter Frequency

Given a string and a target letter, determine how many times that letter appears in the given string.
